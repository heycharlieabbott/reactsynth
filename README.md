# Web Synthesizer

This is a toolkit for experimental music production in the browser made using React.JS, Tone.JS, and Firebase.

There are currently two synthesizers called "osc steps" and "texture gen", with more in development. Each synthesizer has a similar organizational structure that mimics traditional hardware synthesizer design. The structure from top to bottom is as follows:

1.  User interface (sliders, knobs, menus, etc.)

    - Example:

2.  Sequencer (rhythmic patterns, loops, etc.)

    - Example:

3.  Audio Module Connections ()

    - Example:

4.  Oscillators
    - Example:

All state information for Synth 2 is managed using the context API which allows for easy parameter randomization.
